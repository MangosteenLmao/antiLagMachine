# antiLagMachine
automatically detects and removes lag machines every 30 minutes with the /lagcheck command.

limit of blocks before they are all wiped is 1000, adjustable.

feel free to add more blocks to check for in the super long if statement with format:
m == Material.yourmaterialhere
  
feel free to use, modify, adjust, whatever you want!

v2.0 branch:
added config.yml
has a limit and list of materials in it to change (if you want), tidied up a loop

v2.1 branch:
added time delay to config.yml (in minutes) of how often to run a lagcheck
